This one was a fun small project to get accusomted to Ajax as I've always used fetch. 

In order to switch between the two, in the index.html file, comment out the script you do not want to use and uncomment the script you do want to use. 

Ex: Using Fetch 
<!-- <script src="ajax.js"></script> -->
    <script src="fetch.js"></script>
